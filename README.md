# Project Title: SMS Spam Detection

**Problem Statement:**
Mobile messaging is a widely used form of communication, with billions of users exchanging numerous messages. 
However, this convenience comes with the challenge of spam messages, making communication insecure. The task 
is to develop a reliable model capable of accurately detecting whether a given SMS is spam or ham (non-spam).

**Project Flow:**

Problem Statement:
Identify the need for secure mobile communication by addressing the issue of spam in SMS.

Data Gathering:
Collect relevant data containing labeled SMS messages, distinguishing between spam and ham.

Data Preprocessing:
Perform operations on the data to enhance its quality and relevance.
A. Tokenization
B. Convert text to lowercase
C. Remove stopwords
D. Lemmatization / Stemming


Vectorization (Convert Text data into the Vector):
Transform textual data into numerical vectors for model training.
A. Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
B. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)


Model Building:
Develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the preprocessed data.
A. Initialize the model object
B. Train and test the model using the prepared dataset

Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using various metrics.
A. Accuracy Score
B. Confusion Matrix
C. Classification Report


Model Deployment
Implement the model for practical use, making it ready for real-time predictions.


Prediction on Client Data
Apply the deployed model to predict whether new SMS messages are spam or ham.



Tech Stack Used:

Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Machine Learning Algorithms
The project employs a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to address the challenge of SMS spam, providing a robust solution for secure mobile communication.
